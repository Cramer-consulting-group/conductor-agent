# 💬 Chat Functionality Overview

## What Was Added

### 1. **Conductor Agent** (`conductor/agent.py`)

The core conversational AI that:

- **Retrieves context** from your conversation history using semantic search
- **Generates intelligent responses** using GPT-4o-mini (or your chosen model)
- **Cites sources** showing which platform and conversation the answer came from
- **Streams responses** in real-time for better UX

### 2. **Updated CLI** (`cli/interactive.py`)

Now when you ask a question, instead of just showing search results, the conductor:

1. 🔍 Searches your conversation history
2. 🧠 Feeds relevant context to the LLM
3. 💬 Generates a conversational answer
4. 📚 Shows sources with platform badges

## How It Works

```text
You: "What projects have I worked on?"
        ↓
Conductor retrieves relevant conversations from all platforms
        ↓
Sends context + query to GPT-4o-mini
        ↓
Streams intelligent, synthesized response
        ↓
Cites sources (e.g., "Based on your Antigravity conversation...")
```

## Example Interaction

```text
You: How did I implement authentication in previous projects?

Conductor: Based on your conversation history, you've implemented 
authentication several times across different projects:

1. **From your ChatGPT conversation "API Authentication Design"**: 
   You implemented JWT-based auth with refresh tokens...

2. **From your Antigravity conversation "Building User System"**: 
   You used OAuth2 with Google Sign-In...

📚 Sources:
  • CHATGPT: API Authentication Design (relevance: 94%)
  • ANTIGRAVITY: Building User System (relevance: 87%)
  • GEMINI: Security Best Practices (relevance: 78%)
```

## Key Features

✅ **RAG Architecture**: Retrieval Augmented Generation
✅ **Multi-Platform**: Answers using all your AI conversations
✅ **Source Attribution**: Shows where information came from
✅ **Streaming**: Real-time response display
✅ **Error Handling**: Clear error messages if API key missing

## What You Need

1. **OpenAI API Key** in `.env` file:

   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
   ```

2. **Ingest your conversations** first:

   ```powershell
   python ingest.py
   ```

3. **Start chatting**:

   ```powershell
   python -m cli.interactive
   ```

Now you have a REAL conversational assistant that remembers everything! 🎉
